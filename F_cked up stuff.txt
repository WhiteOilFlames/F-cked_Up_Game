- reloading: trow away guns
- fitting stuf in to small boxes
- opening doors but smashing the know in there and turning the key
- instead of buying guns you buy magazines
- doors that lead to nothing, lead to rooms
- you bind cars and horses to yourself
- when healing you just break a finger or arm
- you rip out hearts to get money
- cntrl is jump space is duck
- for aiming you pop off your arm and put it back on
- grenades implode
- the shopkeeper is a cockroach who makes questionable statements
